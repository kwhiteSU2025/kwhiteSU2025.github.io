            <h1>My name is Kieran</h1>
            <p>I'm a programming student. CSS and HTML are the things I was most familiar with before starting these classes.
                This is because I'm kind of old and had to actually code in my website on social media when I was a teenager instead of the website just being a stencil.
                I like to play video games. My favorite video game right now is Elden Ring, but I spend most of my time playing FFXIV, because it's an MMO and I'm not going to play a subscription to a game I don't play at least 3 times a week.</p>
